# User Story 4, Creating a Doctor
# As a visitor
# When I visit a hospital's show page
# I see a link to add a doctor for this hospital
# When I click that link
# I'm taken to a page that has a title of "New Doctor Hire for <insert hospital name here>"
# And on that page there's a form for me to enter a new doctor's name, specialty, and university where they got their doctorate.
# When I fill out all three fields and click submit
# I am taken back to the hospital show page
# And I can see that the number of doctors has increased by one
